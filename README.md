***This was my first Virtual Internship Programm experience, working as a Web Developer. All thanks to [Oasis Infobytes](https://oasisinfobyte.com) for giving me this opportunity to work with them as a Web Development intern in this month of March.***

# Task- 1/Calculator
1. It takes a little skill to create a calculator with basic mathematical functionalities using  HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
2. Calculators require an interactive interface to perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. 
3. It will need a display screen to display the user’s input and give the results. 
4. The grid system in CSS is for the alignments of buttons on the calculator. 
5. The additional tools you need to build a fully functional calculator include eventListeners, if-else statements, operators, loops, and so on.
6. I also add a dark/light mode which looks good to the website.
