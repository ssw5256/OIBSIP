                <h2>Childhood and Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Ratan Tata was born on 28th December 1937 to Naval Tata and Sonoo Tata. He has a brother Jimmy and a
                    step-brother, Noel Tata. When Ratan Tata was 10 years old, his parents separated. Both the brothers
                    were brought up by their grandmother Navajbai Tata. His early schooling was done in Mumbai at
                    Campion School and John Connon School. He received his degree in Architecture with structural
                    engineering from Cornell University, U.S.A. In 1975 he completed an advanced management programme at

                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>
                    He joined Tata Sons in 1962, where he worked on the floor. It was a strenuous and difficult job, but
                    he gained experience and understanding of the family business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1971, he was made Director-in-charge of the NELCO (National Radio and Electronics Company Ltd).
                    The company was going through a financial crisis phase. Ratan Tata worked hard to build an improved
                    consumer electronics division, but the economic recession and Union issues did not prove successful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1977, he was transferred to Empress Mills, another struggling Tata Group unit. He made a plan for
                    the mill’s revival, but the other company executives rejected it, and the mill was shut down. Ratan
                    Tata was yet again moved to Tata Industries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1991, JRD Tata appointed Ratan Tata the Chairman of the Tata Group. There were objections from
                    other executives amid concern regarding his ability to manage the responsibilities. Once at the Tata
                    Group’s helm, Ratan Tata successfully improved the organisation’s overall position. He modified the
                    management and vision of the division and also managed to increase the dividends. During this
                    period, he was also a Prime Minister’s Council on Trade and Industry member. He was on the advisory
                    board of the RAND for the Asia Pacific Policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is an active member of India’s AIDS initiative program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is also a member of the Mitsubishi corporation international advisory board, JP Morgan Chase,
                    Booz Allen Hamilton, and the American International Group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In December 2012, on his 75th birthday, Ratan Tata resigned as chairman of Tata Group. Cyrus Mistry,
                    the Managing Director of Shapoorji Pallonji Group, became the new chairman of the Tata Group. He
                    acted as the interim chairman from October 2016 through February 2017.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Retirement does not hold him back as he still actively invests in new promising business ventures.
                    He is a dedicated philanthropist and contributes significantly to various charities in the country.

                <h2>Ratan Tata - Major Successes</h2>
                <p>
                    In the capacity of Tata Group’s Chairman, he took the company to such heights that it was
                    prestigiously recognized at the international level. The company achieved great financial success,
                    and the Tata Group reached the New York Stock Exchange. Under his leadership, Tata Group became a
                    global brand with its acquisition of companies such as Corus, Jaguar Land Rover, and Tetley. The
                    Tata Nano and Tata Indica automobiles were conceived and built under his leadership.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A major philanthropist, he has invested over 65 percent of his share in charitable trusts. A key
                    goal of his life is to give Indians a better quality of life and ensure human development.
